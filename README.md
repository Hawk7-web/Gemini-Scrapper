# Gemini-Scrapper
HAWK is a fully automated, headless Gemini web controller built with Selenium and Rich. It sends prompts, auto-formats comparison questions into markdown tables, extracts responses with multi-layer DOM parsing, and displays them in beautiful terminal UI. Fast, stealthy, and fully hands-free.
